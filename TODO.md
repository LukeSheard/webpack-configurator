## Required for v1.0.0:

- [ ] Cloning complex objects should simply reference. See [#2](https://github.com/lewie9021/webpack-configurator/issues/2).
- [ ] Document each method parameter in the docs.
- [ ] Add test cases for each example.
- [ ] Remove old files.

## Future plans:

- [ ] Move documentation to GitBook.
- [ ] Split out code for loaders and plugins to seperate files.
- [ ] Identify and reduce code duplication (requires specs to be completed).
